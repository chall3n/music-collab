### **Project Management Feature (Multi-User Collaboration):**

*   **Core Implementation:** Implemented project creation, user-to-project linking, and project-based filtering of demos/stems.
*   **Supabase Schema:**
    *   `projects` table: Stores project names.
    *   `project_users` table: Links users (`auth.users.id`) to projects (`projects.id`).
    *   `demos` table: Added `project_id` foreign key to link demos to projects.
*   **Client-side State:** `useProjectStore` (Zustand) manages active project and user's project list.
*   **Backend API:** `/api/projects` (GET/POST) handles project retrieval and creation, filtering by user membership.
*   **UI:** `ProjectSidebar.tsx` for project selection/creation. `Whiteboard.tsx` now filters demos by active project.

### **Current Known Issue: Stale Demos on User Switch:**

*   **Problem:** After logging out and logging in as a different user, demos from the *previous* user's session briefly appear on the `Whiteboard`.
*   **Attempted Fix:** Implemented `clearDemos()` in `useAudioStore` and `clearProjects()` in `useProjectStore`, called on logout.
*   **Why it persists:** Likely a React rendering/Zustand state propagation timing issue. The component might briefly render with old state before the cleared state is fully reflected.
*   **Next Steps/Debugging:** Need to investigate the exact timing of state updates and component re-renders.

### **Next Feature (Planned):**

*   **Add User to Project:** Backend API (`/api/projects/[projectId]/users`) for adding users to a project by email (requires `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`). Frontend UI for this is pending.

    **Real-time Sync:** Leverage Supabase Realtime subscriptions so that when one user uploads a demo, it instantly appears for all other users in the same project without needing a page refresh.
