## Refactor Summary (Post-Implementation)

This section summarizes the changes made to implement the plan above.

### `src/store/audioStore.ts`

*   **Data Structures:** Replaced the flat `AudioFile` interface with the new nested `Demo` and `Stem` interfaces.
*   **State:** The `audioFiles` array was replaced with a `demos` array.
*   **Actions:**
    *   `fetchAudioFiles` was replaced with `fetchDemos`, which now correctly queries the `demos` and `stems` tables from the database and combines them.
    *   `uploadAudio` was replaced with `uploadDemo`, which uploads a file and creates a corresponding record in the `demos` table.
    *   A new `uploadStem` action was added to handle uploading stem files and linking them to a parent demo via a foreign key.

### `src/components/Whiteboard.tsx`

*   **Store Integration:** Updated the component to use the new `demos` state and the `fetchDemos` and `uploadDemo` actions from the `useAudioStore`.
*   **Props:** Updated the mapping logic to pass the correct props (`id`, `master_url`, `name`, `stems`) to the `WaveformPlayer` component.
*   **Functionality:** The file input now correctly calls `uploadDemo`.

### `src/components/WaveformPlayer.tsx`

*   **Props:** The component's props were updated to accept the new `Demo` structure, including the `stems` array.
*   **Upload Logic Removed:** The responsibility for uploading stems was removed from this component.
*   **Stem Upload Trigger:** A new handler (`handleStemUpload`) was added to call the `uploadStem` action from the store, cleanly separating the UI from the business logic.
*   **Display Logic:** The component now maps over the `stems` prop to display the list of associated stems.

## Collaboration Feature Plan

This section outlines the future plan to add multi-user collaboration features to the application.

1.  **Phase 0: User Authentication:** Implement a login/signup system using Supabase Auth. This is the foundation that gives every user a unique identity (`auth.uid()`).
2.  **Phase 1: Database Structure:** Create three new database entities:
    *   A `projects` table to hold the name of each session.
    *   A `project_users` table to link users to the projects they are members of.
    *   Add a `project_id` column to our existing `demos` table to link each audio file to a specific project.
3.  **Phase 2: State Management:** Create a new `useProjectStore` in Zustand to manage the list of projects and track the currently active one. We would then modify `useAudioStore` to only fetch and upload demos for that active project.
4.  **Phase 3: UI Integration:** Build a `ProjectSidebar` component where users can see their projects and switch between them. The main `Whiteboard` would then react to the selection, loading the correct demos.
5.  **Phase 4: Real-time Sync:** Leverage Supabase Realtime subscriptions so that when one user uploads a demo, it instantly appears for all other users in the same project without needing a page refresh.

## API Refactor Plan: Efficiently Fetching Demos and Stems

**Objective:** To improve performance and simplify frontend logic by replacing the current client-side data fetching in `fetchDemos` with a dedicated server-side API endpoint. This moves the work of combining `demos` and `stems` from the user's browser to our backend.

---

### **Phase 1: Create the Backend API Endpoint**

1.  **Create the API Route File:**
    *   Create a new file at: `src/app/api/demos/route.ts`.

2.  **Implement the Server-Side Logic:**
    *   Define an asynchronous `GET` function that will be executed on the server.
    *   Inside `GET`, perform the following steps:
        a. **Fetch Demos:** Make an async call to Supabase to `select * from demos`.
        b. **Fetch Stems:** Make another async call to Supabase to `select * from stems`.
        c. **Combine Data:** On the server, create the final nested data structure. Use a `map` function on the `demosData` array. For each `demo`, filter the `stemsData` array to find all stems where `stem.demo_id` matches `demo.id`.
        d. **Return Response:** If successful, send the combined, nested array back to the client as a JSON response with a `200 OK` status.
        e. **Error Handling:** Wrap the logic in a `try...catch` block. If any part of the process fails, return a `500 Internal Server Error` response with an error message.

---

### **Phase 2: Refactor the Frontend `audioStore`**

1.  **Target the `fetchDemos` Action:**
    *   Open the file: `src/store/audioStore.ts`.
    *   Locate the `fetchDemos` function.

2.  **Simplify the Implementation:**
    *   **Remove Old Logic:** Delete the two separate `supabase.from(...)` calls for `demos` and `stems`. Remove the client-side logic that combines them.
    *   **Add New Logic:** Replace the deleted code with a single `try...catch` block containing:
        a. **Fetch from API:** Make a single `fetch` call to our new endpoint: `const response = await fetch('/api/demos');`.
        b. **Process Response:** Check if `response.ok`. If not, throw an error.
        c. **Set State:** Parse the JSON from the response (`const data = await response.json();`) and update the state directly with this pre-packaged data: `set({ demos: data });`.
    *   The entire `fetchDemos` function body should be significantly shorter and simpler.

## User Authentication Implementation Summary

This section summarizes the implementation of a complete user authentication flow using Supabase and the resolution of a critical bug in the password reset process.

### 1. Core Authentication Setup

*   **Dependencies:** Installed `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` and `@supabase/auth-ui-react` to integrate Supabase authentication with the Next.js application.
*   **Login Page:** Created a new route at `/login` that utilizes Supabase's pre-built `<Auth>` component to provide a ready-made UI for email/password and social logins (GitHub, Google).
*   **Callback Route:** Implemented a required server-side API route at `/auth/callback` for Supabase to securely complete the authentication handshake after a user logs in.
*   **Page Protection:** The main page (`/`) was updated to be a protected route. It now checks for an active user session and automatically redirects any unauthenticated users to the `/login` page, ensuring only logged-in users can access the core application.

### 2. Password Reset Bug and Fix

*   **The Issue:** A critical flaw was identified where clicking the password reset link in the confirmation email led to an infinite loop. The link redirected to the generic `/login` page, which was not configured to handle the password recovery token in the URL, thus preventing the user from ever seeing the password reset form.

*   **The Solution:**
    1.  **Dedicated Reset Page:** A new page was created at `/reset-password`. This page uses the same `<Auth>` component but is explicitly configured with `view="update_password"` to render the correct form.
    2.  **Email Template Update:** The "Reset Password" email template in the Supabase dashboard was updated to send users to the new `/reset-password` URL instead of the old `/login` URL.
    3.  **Production-Ready URLs:** The Supabase project's **URL Configuration** was properly set up to handle both production and development environments. The production domain was set as the main **Site URL**, and `http://localhost:3000` was added to the list of allowed **Redirect URLs**. This ensures the authentication and password reset flows work seamlessly whether running locally or when deployed.

## BUT...
resetting password just logs the user in without any resetting of passwords.
